bootstrap-formvalidation
========================

Living alongside Bootstrap-based webpages, this will use HTML5 tags to validate inputs. Validation can be used to find callbacks, as well as overridden on a per-input basis.  Validation can also feed into a "Form Control", which is a listening framework setup to perform actions based on completing--or not--the validation of any number of inputs.
