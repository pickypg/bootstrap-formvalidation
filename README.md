bootstrap-formvalidation
========================

Living alongside Bootstrap-based webpages, this will use HTML5 tags to validate inputs. Validation can be used to find callbacks, as well as overridden on a per-input basis.  Validation can also feed into a "Form Control", which is a listening framework setup to perform actions based on completing--or not--the validation of any number of inputs.

bootstrap-formvalidation.js: Enables validation of HTML5 controls, or JavaScript driven content.
bootstrap-formcontrol.js: Listens to formValidation to determine an overall ready-state.

This entire project is a work in progress, and the docs will eventually be updated to add examples before this reaches version 1.0.

I will be adding a bootstrap-wizard and potentially a bootstrap-table as time allows.
